# Instructions

This document serves as a high-level map for executing game development skills.
Each set of skills is described in a dedicated `*.md` file as listed below:

* `PREREQUISITES.md` specifies the environment configuration and any pre-requisites that need to be met; this is the first place we need to look at.
* `WORKFLOW.md` describes the general game development workflow and should be referred to periodically as needed.
* `GAME-ENGINE.md` documents the game engine and APIs; it may also simply refer to external documentation.
* `ASSETS.md` describes how the various game assets and config should be used, i.e. sprites/atlas, tiles, backgrounds, sounds.
* `TESTING.md` describes how the game shall be run/tested/evaluated.
