# Game Engine

We use Phaser JS game engine.

Refer to https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/making-your-first-phaser-game to get an overview
on all the different pieces required to put a game together.

For more detailed documentation on animations, actions, input, physics, etc, refer to https://docs.phaser.io/ and
perform a rigorous search.

For loading tilemaps/tilesets in Phaser, use `load.image('tiles' ...)` and `load.tilemapTiledJSON('map', ...)`.
